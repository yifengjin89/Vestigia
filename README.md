# CSC336 DATABASE PROJECT

## PROJECT NAME: VESTIGIA

# Description:
Used python program to design an application to keep track of the user’s job applications. This application is a social media platform that helps keep track of a user's application status during the hiring process as well as enables them to share the details of these jobs with other users. Each user has their own profile where they can track the jobs they applied for and manually edit each position block with an updated application status as needed. Using this software, users can track their job application status in a fun and creative way that lets them share the process with others.

1. Clone this repository 

2. From command line cd Vestigia

3. Run command: set FLASK_APP=main.py

4. Run command: set FLASK_DEBUG=1

5. Run command: flask run

6. In your browser head to http://localhost:5000/

7. Or run from PyCharm and go to browser

In doing so, any changes you make will be reflected upon refreshing the browser, that way you don't have to constantly restart the web server


**Used python program to design an web application with python flask and MYSQL**

# Requirements

  - Download and install Python, We used Python 3.7.1, make sure to check the box Add Python to PATH on the installation setup screen.
  - Download and install MySQL Community Server and MySQL Workbench, you can skip this step if you already have a MySQL server set up.
  - Install Python Flask with the command: pip install flask
  - Install Flask-MySQLdb with the command: pip install flask-mysqldb

- app.secret_key = '111'
- app.config['MYSQL_HOST'] = 'localhost'
- app.config['MYSQL_USER'] = 'root'
- app.config['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] = '111111'
- app.config['MYSQL_DB'] = 'database_project'
- Open Command Prompt, make sure you have the project directory selected, you can do this with the command cd c:\your_project_folder_destination\python main.py on Windows.
